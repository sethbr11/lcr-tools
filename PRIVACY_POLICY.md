# Privacy Policy for LCR Tools

**Last Updated:** Sept 29, 2025

This privacy policy explains how the "LCR Tools" Chrome Extension ("the extension") handles your data. Your privacy is very important to us. The core principle of this extension is that **your data is your data**.

## Data Collection and Usage

The extension is designed to interact with the content of Leader and Clerk Resources (LCR) pages (`lcr.churchofjesuschrist.org`, `https://lcrf.churchofjesuschrist.org`, and `https://lcrffe.churchofjesuschrist.org`) that you are actively viewing in your browser.

- **Data Read from the Page:** The extension reads information directly from the LCR web page to perform its functions. This includes data from tables in reports, member lists, and other page content required to enable features like data export.
- **No Data Transmission:** The extension **does not** collect, store, or transmit any of your personal information or browsing data to any external server or third party. All processing happens locally on your computer.
- **User-Initiated Exports:** Features like "Download Report Data" or "Export Member List" compile data from the page and allow you to save it directly to your computer as a CSV file. This data is never sent anywhere else; the file is created and downloaded entirely within your browser. You are responsible for this data.

## Data Storage

The extension **does not** store any personal data. It may use Chrome's local storage for benign settings related to the extension's functionality, but not for your personal information from LCR.

## Permissions Justification

The extension requests the following permissions:

- `"host_permissions": ["https://lcr.churchofjesuschrist.org/*", "https://lcrf.churchofjesuschrist.org/*", "https://lcrffe.churchofjesuschrist.org/*"],`: This permission is required for the extension to interact with the LCR and LCR Finances websites. It allows the extension's scripts to run on LCR pages to provide its features. The extension does not access any other websites.
- `scripting`: This permission is necessary to inject the code that provides the extension's features onto the LCR pages.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this privacy policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new privacy policy on this page.
